This applet allows spoke lengths to be calculated.  Choose, front or rear wheel.
You should also specify whether you know the Effective Rim Diameter, or whether
it must be computed from the Inside Diameter of the rim plus the nipple dimensions.
This version allows for offset rear rims, and specification of the spoke angle
rather than the crossing pattern.  This allows for non-uniform spoking patterns, 
paired spokes and so on.
