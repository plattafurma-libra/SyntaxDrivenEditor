
This program is an example of an applet written entirely in Component Pascal.
It uses only the old-fashioned AWT libraries. Yes, it is pretty old!

It computes bicycle wheel spoke lengths given the geometry of the rim and
hubs and the spoking pattern.

Unlike many such programs it deals with irregular spoking patterns and 
rims with offset spoke beds.

It is precompiled in this directory, and may be compiled using just
> cprun gpcp SpokeLength3.cp
All code is in the one source file. However, the browser must be able
to reach the runtime libraries, which means that classes for the
CP.RTS, CP.CPJ, CP.CPJrts packages must be present in the codebase.
